# 📚 City Library Management System (Java)

A Java-based **City Library Management System** demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming and Exception Handling concepts. The project allows users to add books, issue books, return books, search books, and display the full library collection.

This system is menu-driven and terminal-based, built using:

- Classes & Objects
- Arrays
- Custom Exceptions
- `try-catch`, `throw`, and `throws`
- Input validation
